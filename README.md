# COSMIC database preprocessing
This script uses the cosmic coding VCF file and Mutant export data (tsv) to generate tumor site counts per variant.

#### Software requirements:
- Python v2.7
- progressbar2
- sh
- Mac OSX (>=10.11) and Linux (Ubuntu 14, debian 9)

Hardware requirements:
- single CPU/Thread
- 2 GB RAM

Commandline arguments
```bash
python process_cosmic_data.py CosmicCodingMuts.vcf.gz CosmicMutantExport.tsv.gz
```
- CosmicCodingMut.vcf.gz - VCF file of all coding mutations in the current release.
- CosmicMutantExport.tsv.gz - A tab separated table of all COSMIC coding point mutations from targeted and genome wide screens from the current release. 
- Further details at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download 

By default, output file `cosmic_processed.txt` is generated by the script.
Output file structure example:
```
11      66204714        C       T       COSM6715269;COSM6715270 large_intestine=1
```

#### Fields:
1. Chromosome
2. Position
3. Ref
4. Alt
5. COSMIC ID(s). Multiple COSMIC IDs are delimited by `;`
6. Frequency distribution across tumor types. Multiple entries are delimited by `;`

##### _NOTE: input files must be gzipped (by default gzipped with downloaded from COSMIC's database)_
